# Two Sum Problem Details

The Two Sum problem is a classic problem in computer science that involves finding two numbers in a given list that add up to a specific target number. It is a common problem that is often used to test the skills of aspiring software engineers and data scientists.

Here is the formal definition of the problem:

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return a tuple of two integers `(i, j)`, such that `nums[i] + nums[j] = target` and `i â‰  j`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

For example, given the list `[2, 7, 11, 15]` and the target number `9`, the function should return a tuple `(0, 1)`, because `nums[0] = 2` and `nums[1] = 7` add up to `9`.

One way to solve the Two Sum problem is by using a brute force approach. This involves looping through the list of numbers and checking every possible pair of numbers to see if they add up to the target number. While this method is simple to implement, it has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` and is not suitable for large lists.

A more efficient way to solve the Two Sum problem is by using a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for fast lookup of values by their keys. To solve the Two Sum problem using a hash table, we can store the differences between the target number and each element in the list in a hash table. Then, we can loop through the list and check if the difference between the target number and the current element is in the hash table. If it is, we have found a pair of numbers that add up to the target number. This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`.

There are other approaches to solving the Two Sum problem, such as using a binary search tree or sorting the list and using two pointers to find the pair of numbers. However, the hash table approach is generally the most efficient and is the one most commonly used in practice.

It is important to note that the Two Sum problem has a unique solution, meaning that there is only one pair of numbers that adds up to the target number. This simplifies the problem and allows for more efficient solutions.

Overall, the Two Sum problem is a useful problem to understand and solve, as it tests the ability to design and implement efficient algorithms and data structures. It is a problem that will likely come up in interviews and on the job, and having a strong understanding of it will be beneficial to any aspiring software engineer or data scientist.

To solve the Two Sum problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function with the parameters nums (a list of integers) and target (the target number that the two numbers in the list should add up to).
1. Create an empty dictionary called `diff_dict`.
1. Loop through the elements in nums and their indices using a for loop.
1. Calculate the difference between the target number and the current element in the loop.
1. Check if the difference is in the `diff_dict` dictionary. If it is, return a tuple containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number. The first element of the tuple is the value stored in the `diff_dict` dictionary under the key diff, and the second element is the current index.
1. If the difference is not in the `diff_dict` dictionary, store the current element and its index in the dictionary.
1. After the for loop completes, return None if no pair of numbers that add up to the target number was found.
