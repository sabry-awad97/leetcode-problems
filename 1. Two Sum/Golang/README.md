# Solution in Golang

Here is the brute force solution to the Two Sum problem in Go:

```go
// TwoSumBruteForce finds the indices of two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number using a brute force approach.
// It has a time complexity of O(n^2).
func TwoSumBruteForce(nums []int, target int) []int {
 for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
  for j := i + 1; j < len(nums); j++ {
   if nums[i] + nums[j] == target {
    return []int {j, i}
   }
  }
 }
 return []int {-1, -1}
}
```

- This solution uses nested for loops to check every possible pair of numbers in the list to see if they add up to the target number. If a pair is found, the function returns a slice of their indices. If no pair is found, the function returns a slice of -1, -1.

To implement hash table solution in Go, you can use the following steps:

1. Define a function with the parameters nums (a slice of integers) and target (the target number that the two numbers in the list should add up to). The function should return a slice of integers, which will be the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number.

1. Create a map called diffDict that will be used to store the differences between the target number and each element in the list. The keys of the map will be the elements and the values will be their indices.

1. Loop through the elements in nums and their indices using a for loop. For each element, calculate the difference between the target number and the element.

1. Check if the difference is in the diffDict map. If it is, return a slice containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number (stored in the diffDict map under the key diff and the current index).

1. If the difference is not in the diffDict map, store the current element and its index in the map.

1. If the for loop completes without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target number, return an empty slice.

Here is an example implementation of this solution in Go:

```go
// TwoSumHashTable finds the indices of two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number using a hash table.
// It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).
func TwoSumHashTable(nums []int, target int) []int {
 diffDict := make(map[int]int)
 for i, num := range nums {
  diff := target - num
  if j, ok := diffDict[diff]; ok {
   return []int {j, i}
  }
  diffDict[num] = i
 }
 return []{-1, -1}
}
```

- This solution uses a map (Go's equivalent of a hash table) to store the differences between the target number and each element in the list. It then loops through the list and checks if the difference between the target number and the current element is in the map. If it is, the function returns a slice of the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number. If the difference is not in the map, the current element and its index are stored in the map. If the loop completes without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target number, the function returns a slice of -1, -1.
