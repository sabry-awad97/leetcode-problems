# Solution in Python

Here is an example of a brute force solution:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return (i, j)
    return None
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), as it requires nested loops to check every possible pair of numbers.

A more efficient solution would be to use a hash table to store the differences between the target number and each element in the list. Then, we can simply check if the difference is in the hash table, and if it is, we have found a pair that adds up to the target number. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

Here is an example of this solution:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    diff_dict = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in diff_dict:
            return (diff_dict[diff], i)
        diff_dict[num] = i
    return None
```

Here is a description of the solution

```python
def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> Tuple[int, int] | None:
    """
    Finds the indices of two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number.

    Parameters:
    nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
    target (int): The target number that the two numbers in the list should add up to.

    Returns:
    Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number. If no such numbers are found, returns None.

    Examples:
    twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) => (0, 1)
    twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) => (1, 2)
    twoSum([3, 2, 4], 7) => None
    """
```

- The first line defines the function `twoSum` with parameters `nums` and `target`. The docstring contains a brief description of the function, as well as the types and names of the parameters and the return value. It also includes examples of how the function can be used.

```python
    diff_dict = {}
```

- This line creates an empty dictionary called `diff_dict`. It will be used to store the differences between the target number and each element in the list.

```python
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
```

- This line starts a for loop that iterates over the elements in `nums` and their indices. The `enumerate` function returns a tuple containing the index and the element for each iteration of the loop.

```python
        diff = target - num
```

- This line calculates the difference between the `target` number and the current element in the loop.

```python
        if diff in diff_dict:
```

- This line checks if the difference is in the `diff_dict` dictionary. If it is, it means that we have found a pair of numbers that add up to the `target` number.

```python
            return (diff_dict[diff], i)
```

- If the difference is in the `diff_dict` dictionary, this line returns a tuple containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number. The first element of the tuple is the value stored in the `diff_dict` dictionary under the key `diff`, and the second element is the current index i.

```python
        diff_dict[num] = i
```

- If the difference is not in the `diff_dict` dictionary, this line stores the current element and its index in the dictionary.

```python
    return None
```

- If the for loop completes without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target number, this line returns `None`.
